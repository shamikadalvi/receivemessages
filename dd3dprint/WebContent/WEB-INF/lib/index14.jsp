This video elaborates the demonstration of a Rubik's cube solver Bot
using CFOP method and java as the coding language the project was divided 
into 2 parts the first part takes the UI input from the user and the solution
is displayed on the screen.The second part we have implemented the hardware 
integration using 6 stepper drivers and ARM is used as microcontroller the code
which was initially written in java was converted into C for the entire 
implementation.

The Bot takes around 1 min 15 seconds to solve any given scramble
